~ If it doesnt work anymore, means firefox removed this option ~

109.0 firefox update moves all installed extensions to one button. If you want to roll back and have your 
extensions separated and put icons anywhere on the bar do as follow:

- In search bar type 'about:config' -> 'accept' -> search for 'extensions.unifiedExtensions.enabled' and set it to False.

- Want to have all extensions in one button? Set the same function to True.
